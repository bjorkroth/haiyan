The brick raw material mixture is molded into bricks using rotary table press which uses mechanical pressure to press the bricks. In the final stage, bricks are placed in autoclave where saturated steam pressure is released and the temperature inside the chamber is raised and the reaction process begins.

Aluminium losses in melting are low, roughly 3%. The thermal energy from natural gas used to melt aluminium scrap in many recycling facilities contributes to the consumption of about 52% of the total non-renewable energy consumption for secondary ingot production. Correspondingly, natural gas contributes 48% of GWP-GHG A1-3.
